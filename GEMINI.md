# Project: Park Babelsberg Website

## Project Overview

This is a static website for providing information about the Park Babelsberg in Potsdam, Germany. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it includes an interactive map, dark mode, and internationalization features. The project is tested with Playwright and deployed on Vercel.

## Building and Running

The project is a static website, so there is no build process required. To run the website locally, you can use a simple HTTP server. The `playwright.config.ts` file includes a command to run a local server for testing purposes.

To run the tests, use the following commands:

*   `npm install` to install the dependencies.
*   `npm test` to run the Playwright tests.

## Development Conventions

*   The website uses a modern, minimalist design system with a focus on accessibility and user experience.
*   The CSS is well-structured and uses custom properties for theming and dark mode.
*   The JavaScript code is organized into modules and uses modern features.
*   The project includes a comprehensive test suite using Playwright.
*   The `vercel.json` file defines the deployment configuration, including routing and redirects.
